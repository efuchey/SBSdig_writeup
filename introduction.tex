\section{Introduction to the SBS software}


The purpose of the digitization program is to generate realistic read-out electronic signals (ADCs, TDCs) for the SBS detectors using energy deposits (and photoelectrons when energy deposits are not available) recorded by the G4SBS simulations. This is performed in two main steps. The first step is the conversion of the energy deposits and photo-electrons an electric charge that is used to normalize a pulse shape function. The actual processing of this first step highly depends on what detector is considered and will be detailed further. The second step is the processing of the pulse by the front-end and read-out electronics. Again, this process depends on the electronics type (ADC or TDC).
